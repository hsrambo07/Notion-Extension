   - Processes both text and files
   - Supports section targeting
   - Detailed logging and error reporting

2. **Agent Enhancements**
   - File upload to Notion with retries and error handling
   - Automatic format detection for text content
   - Support for section targeting with files
   - Image validation and processing

3. **Notion Blocks**
   - Added image block support with validation
   - Added file block support with validation
   - Enhanced format detection for text content
   - Proper structure for rich_text fields

### Client-side Components

1. **NotionUploadHandler Class**
   - Handles text uploads
   - Handles file uploads
   - Processes clipboard data (text and images)
   - Implements retry logic and error handling

2. **Clipboard Integration**
   - Detects and processes pasted images
   - Handles mixed content pastes
   - Section targeting through data attributes
   - Success and error callbacks

3. **Demo Page**
   - Interactive clipboard areas for testing
   - File upload form for direct testing
   - Visual feedback for uploads
   - Results display

## Testing

1. **Automated Tests**
   - Test script for various text formats
   - Image upload testing
   - Mixed content testing
   - Section targeting testing
   - Error case testing

2. **Manual Testing Page**
   - HTML demo for clipboard testing
   - Visual feedback for success/failure
   - Multi-file upload testing
   - Section targeting testing

## Error Handling

1. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Validation of inputs
   - Detailed error messages
   - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Format validation

2. **Edge Case Handling**
   - Empty content detection
   - Invalid image format detection
   - Network error retries
   - API error handling

## Improvements Made

1. **Server Endpoint**
   - Enhanced to handle mixed content types
   - Better error reporting
   - Support for multiple files
   - Clipboard data handling

2. **Agent**
   - Improved retry logic
   - Better error handling
   - File type detection
   - Auto-naming for clipboard images

3. **Block Handling**
   - Fixed rich_text structure
   - Added validation
   - Enhanced format detection
   - Support for more content types

4. **Client Library**
   - Easy-to-use JavaScript library
   - Clipboard integration
   - Multiple file support
   - Retry logic

## Integration Points

The media upload functionality integrates with:

1. The existing context-aware handler for section targeting
2. The format detection system for intelligent content type handling
3. The Notion API for block creation and file uploads
4. The client-side extension for user interaction

## User Experience

The implementation provides:

1. Seamless pasting of screenshots and images
2. Support for mixed text and image content
3. Intelligent format detection for text
4. Precise content placement through section targeting
5. Clear feedback on success or failure

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

1. Preview generation for uploaded images
2. Drag-and-drop support for files
3. Progress indicators for large uploads
4. Additional file type support
5. Batch processing optimizations
